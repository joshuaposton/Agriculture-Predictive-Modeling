## Installation
Instructions to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshuaposton/Agriculture-Predictive-Modeling
cd Agriculture-Predictive-Modeling

2. Data:
The data used in this project is located in the data folder:

soil_measures.csv: Contains soil composition data with features like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, pH, and the crop that grows best in that soil type.

3. Features:
	Data Exploration and Visualization: Initial exploration of the dataset with visualizations to understand the distribution of different soil properties.
	Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning models to predict the best crop to plant based on soil composition.
	Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying which soil properties are most influential in determining the ideal crop.

4. Technologies:
	Python: Programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
	Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
	Scikit-learn: Library used for machine learning and predictive modeling.
	Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running and sharing code, visualizations, and narrative text.
